// ## Knowledge Base

// ### Common Financial Questions & Guidance
// - **Loan Amount**: Consider your needs, income, and ability to repay. Start small ($100-500) if building credit. Larger amounts ($2000-5000) work better with established payment history.
// - **Interest Rates**: Vary based on AI credit score (typically 8-15%). Building positive history helps lower future rates. Alternative data assessment is more inclusive than traditional scoring.
// - **Repayment Terms**: Flexible 12-36 month options. Shorter terms (12-18 months) save on interest but require higher monthly payments. Longer terms spread payments but cost more in interest.
// - **Savings Strategy**: Build emergency fund (3-6 months expenses), then focus on wealth building through our savings accounts or group initiatives.
// - **Credit Building**: Consistent on-time payments are most important. Regular savings and participation in group programs also strengthen your financial profile.

// ### When Financial Assistance is Needed
// - Loss of income or employment
// - Unexpected medical or family expenses
// - Small business startup or expansion
// - Education or skill development
// - Emergency cash needs (our fast-track loans available)
// - Seasonal or project-based funding

// ### Financial Health Tips
// - Create and track a monthly budget
// - Start with small, achievable savings goals
// - Make payments on time (set reminders/autopay)
// - Keep emergency fund separate from regular savings
// - Join a savings group for accountability and community
// - Regularly review your financial goals and adjust
// - Learn about financial products before committing
// - Build diverse income streams when possible
